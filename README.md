# pull-stream-examples

this is a short introduction to pull-streams.

Start with [pull.js](./pull.js), which covers the basics.

[compose.js](./compose.js) explores the power of composing pull streams
together.

Also look at [buffering.js](./buffering.js) to learn how to create pull streams
that can return multiple values using buffering, like node streams.

Then see [duplex.js](./duplex.js), to turn node streams into pull streams and
create very simple server.
